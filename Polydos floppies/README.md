# Bob-Edwards -- Nascom Stuff
40 years ago, I had a Nascom 1 in a nice wooden case with a floppy drive. I used to run Polydos, muck about with BL Pascal, Nas-Forth, the graphics character set, a Votrax speech synthesiser and a real time clock. The computer was stolen in a break-in - fools, it was worthless to anyone else.

Since that time, 9 floppy disks of Nascom stuff lay around unusable, the last 25 years in the unheated loft of our house. Miraculously, Neal Crook managed to read all the disks perfectly and this is the contents he sent to me.
