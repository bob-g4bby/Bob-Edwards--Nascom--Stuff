For work, I developed a Nascom1 bus to Ferranti Argus 700 minicomputer Serial Peribus interface.
The Nascom could then drive Argus 700 I/O boards under development much more easily
than wrestling with the Coral 66 programming language on the Argus
I used Blue Label Pascal to really good effect to send and receive 'SeriBus' commands
and display results on the Nascom monitor. The Argus only had a teletype at the time - painful!
