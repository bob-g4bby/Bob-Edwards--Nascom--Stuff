Download all these files into one folder and open the 'Nascom Documentation Library.pdf' document. Test the hyperlinks to see if they jump to the right documents and the right page.

You may have to disable  'reopen at the last page read' in your browser application for it to work. I use Edge in Windows 10 to read pdfs. I had to go into Settings -> Cookies and Site Permissions -> PDF documents -> PDF view settings - set the latter to OFF.

This is version 1 of the library - it has full tables of contents for Nas-Sys 3, CP/M v2.2 and Polydos Users Guide, to get a feel for how quick / handy is two-tier navigation. More full t.o.c.s will follow, I'll up issue the version number to signal the changes.

All comments / suggestions / bug reports are welcome via the Nascom I/O groups website.
