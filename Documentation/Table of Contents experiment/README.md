# Bob-Edwards -- Nascom Stuff
Download and extract the two zip files into one folder and open the 'Nascom Documentation Library.pdf' document. Try the hyperlinks to see if they jump to the right documents and the right page.

You may have to disable the  'reopen the last session' feature in your browser for the links to work reliably. I use Edge in Windows 10 to read pdfs. I had to go into Settings -> Cookies and Site Permissions -> PDF documents -> PDF view settings - set the latter to OFF.

Edge suddenly stopped linking to other pdf documents after an 'update', so I switched to Opera. Once I'd made it the default browser (you can import all your favourites) I coukld browse the Nascom Library again.

This is version 8 of the library - it has many navigable tables of contents for the larger documents. More to follow - I'll up-issue the version number to signal the changes.

All comments / suggestions / bug reports are welcome via the Nascom I/O groups website.
