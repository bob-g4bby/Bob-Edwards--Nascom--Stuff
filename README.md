# Bob-Edwards -- Nascom Stuff
 In the 1980s, I had a Nascom 1  z80 based computer. This is a collection of circuits, documentation and code from that time.
 
 Since 2023, I have a Nascom 4 fpga based computer, designed by Neal Crook, which simulates a 50MHz Z80 computer. I continue to write code and make new hardware for it.
