# Bob-Edwards -- Nascom Stuff
 In the 1980s, I had a Nascom 1  z80 based computer. This is a collection of circuits, documentation and code from that time.
 
 Since 2023, I have a Nascom 4 fpga based computer, designed by Neal Crook, which is equivalent to a Z80 clocked at 50Mhz. Using an SD card for storage, this machine is very quick compared to the original hardware. I continue to write code and make new hardware for it.
