# Bob-Edwards -- Nascom Stuff
 I once had a Nascom 1  z80 based computer. This is a collection of circuits, documentation and code from that time
 I now have a Nascom 4 fpga based computer, designed by Neal Crook, which simulates a 50MHz Z80 computer and I continue to write code and make new hardware for it
